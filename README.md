# Face tracking for automatic video cropping

Playground that uses MediaPipe framework (face detection) to do dynamic frame crop to the section with face. Just PoC.

Supports adding multiple tiles from single or multiple cameras. If some camera doesn't respond properly, it would leave empty tile to be manually removed (known issue).
